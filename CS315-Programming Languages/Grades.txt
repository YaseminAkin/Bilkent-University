Project 1 (with feedback): 

Team 16: (82/100)
Part A: (17/30)

<keyword> you do not have to define something like that. Your tokens need to be connected
to main program. Unconnected BNF -2

Could you please add at least some punctuation to
strings like dot, comma etc. 
You do not have to add all but without all of it 
they may be too hard to read. Readability -1

What about operation precedence (both for arithmetic and logical expressions) -3

<variable initialization> ::= <variable> <equal sign> <initialization right side> | <variable
declaration>
I think you meant <variable declaration or argument>? -1

What does not operation do to integers? 
Do not forget there are no booleans in this language, 
so you need to explain properly -1

With your design I cannot write else if, so I need to have nested ifs. Writability and readability issue -1

Having void return is a reliability issue.
You can do this but you should discuss it in your report and tell why you chose this. -1

No n dimensional collections -1

What if i want to make a collection of a mix of variables and constants? Writability -1

No multiline comments. Writability -1

Part B: (36/40)

Your comment implementation is different than you described -2
INTEGER [+-]?{DIGITS} This will cause problems in yacc -2

Part C: (29/30)

Could you add a more complex expression example
with several operations and parantheses.
These expressions are too simple. -1

Project 2 (with feedback): 98

Uncorrected from Previous Part: (-1)

No n dimensional collections -1
